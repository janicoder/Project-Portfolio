            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am Murtaza Uddin Fatmi. I am learning how to code from Codecademy. I wanted to showcase the things that
                     I am learning in that course so I decided to make this site.
                    Here you will find all the projects that I have created.<br> You can find my work in the section below!
                </p>

            <h2 id="projects">My Projects</h2>
                <p>I have made a few projects so far. Here they are in order:</p>    
                <ol>
                    <li>Dasmoto's art and craft</li>
                        <p>This was the first time I coded something for a website after my initial attempt to learn web 
                            development in 2015. I was able to do so much more now. Back then I was excited out of my mind
                            when I was able to change the color of a text-box. But now I am able to create visually decent
                            designs for websites. I am very proud of how far along I've come but there's more to come and
                            I couldn't be more excited!</p>
                    <li>Fasion Store</li>
                        <p>My friend's sister has a clothing line and I had the idea to try and make a site for her brand.
                            This would be a small step towards my eventual goal of making an E-commerce site</p>
                </ol>
            <h2>What's next?</h2>
                <p>Once I finish this course, I would love to move onto making an E-commerce website! I love coding with friends
                     so if you're interested in coding with me, please reach out to me via the contact page!</p>
